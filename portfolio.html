	    <h2>Things That I Have Done in my Computer Science Class</h2>
	    <h3>Light Bot</h3><img src="lightbot.jpg" alt="Picture of Light Bot">
	    <p style="background-color:red; color:white;">This was one of the first projects that we did during the first semester. Light Bot was a very simple game that taught us some of the basics of coding, like loops. It was very short and easy to finish, but it was still cool none the less.
	    One of my favorite parts about this assignment was that it was a game, which interested me more that if it were just research.</p>

	    <h3>Scratch</h3><img src="scratch.jpg" alt="Picture of Our Scratch Project">
	    <p style="background-color:orange;">This assignment was one of the first big projects that we had gotten. We had been messing around with Scratch for a while, but then we were assigned a project to remix an already made project on Scratch. What this meant was that we had to 
	    take something that was already made on Scratch and then add code to it, or completely rework it, while keeping the same concept. This project was pretty fun to do, especially since I had a partner to help me. What we did was take a role
	    playing type of game, and then expanded on that.</p>

	    <h3>App Inventor</h3><img src="appinventor.jpg" alt="Picture of App Inventor Project Page">
	    <p style="background-color:yellow;">This was one of the harder projects that we have done during my time in this class. At first, we just had to make very simple apps, but then we were assinged the task to make a large app as a group. The app we decided to do was an app that
	    gave you healthy cheap options for food. We only did the basics for the app, but that was only because we weren't given enough time to finish it.</p>

	    <h3>Khan Academy</h3><img src="khanacademy.jpg" alt="Picture of the Assignment on Khan Academy">
	    <p style="background-color:green; color:white;">Khan Academy is one of those websites that almost everybody knows about. For this assignment, we had to use Khan Academy to learn how to code with CSS and HTML. This took about a week to do, and was fairly simple. The website would give us
	    videos that would teach some code, and then it would give us a challenge to do that would use the same code in the video. This assignment was pretty fun, but at the same time it was also pretty easy.</p>

	    <h3>GitHub</h3><img src="github.JPG" alt="Picture of the GitHub homepage.">
	    <p style="background-color:blue; color:white;">GitHub is a website that allows people like you and I to make websites using HTML and CSS, and it also allows us to publish them. In my opinion, I really like 
	    GitHub. It's very easy to use and simple to learn. The assignment that we had to do with this is to create a repository, which allow me to do what I am currently doing. If you didn't know, this entire page was created using GitHub.</p>

	    <h3>Notepad++</h3><img src="notepad.jpg" alt="Picture of my Code on Notepad++">
	    <p style="background-color:purple; color:white;">This is one of the most recent assignment that we have done, aside from making this webpage. What we had to do is make a couple of websites using the app Notepad++. These websites were very simple and easy to make, but they did help to 
	    refresh my memory, since we did this after we came back from Winter break. Personally, I love being able to code with HTML and CSS. I find it very amusing and productive.</p>

	    <h3>Code Combat</h3><img src="codecombat.jpg" alt="Picture of me playing Code Combat">
	    <p style="background-color:pink; color:black;">This is the most recent assignment that we have done in this class. This was supposed to introduce us to python, which is another language used for programming. This game was pretty fun to play, because it constantly made you think about what
	    you had to do next to complete the level. I had a great experience with this game, and I would not mind replaying it or even going into more complicated code.</p>
