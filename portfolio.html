	    <h3>Light Bot</h3><img src="lightbot.jpg" alt="Picture of Light Bot">
	    <p>This was one of the first projects that we did during the first semester. Light Bot was a very simple game that taught us some of the basics of coding, like loops. It was very short and easy to finish, but it was still cool none the less.
	<br>One of my favorite parts about this assignment was that it was a game, which interested me more that if it were just research.</p>

	    <h3>Scratch</h3><img src="scratch.jpg" alt="Picture of Our Scratch Project">
	    <p>This assignment was one of the first big projects that we had gotten. We had been messing around with Scratch for a while, but then we were assigned a project to remix an already made project on Scratch. What this meant was that we had to 
	    <br>take something that was already made on Scratch and then add code to it, or completely rework it, while keeping the same concept. This project was pretty fun to do, especially since I had a partner to help me. What we did was take a role
	    <br>playing type of game, and then expanded on that.</p>

	    <p>This was one of the harder projects that we have done during my time in this class.</p>
