	    <p>This was one of the first projects that we did during the first semester. Light Bot was a very simple game that taught us some of the basics of coding, like loops. It was very short and easy to finish, but it was still cool none the less.
	<br>One of my favorite parts about this assignment was that it was a game, which interested me more that if it were just research.</p>
