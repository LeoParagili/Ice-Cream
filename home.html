		<p>My name is Leo Paragili, I am 14 years old, and I live in Fresno, CA. My hobbies include fishing, going to the range, playing video games, and playing music. I am enrolled in the computer science program at my high school, which is why I am making this website. As of typing this, we are in the second semester, working on coding with HTML and CSS.</p>
